Last year, Universal Studios released Bros, widely touted as the first mainstream queer romantic comedy, and it flopped...hard. Co-writer and star Billy Eichner blamed straight audiences “in certain parts of the country” and “homophobic weirdoes” for its failure, but I was in neither of those demos (you know what parts of the country he was talking about, and New York City isn’t one of them) and I didn’t see it because I didn’t think it looked very good. I did eventually stream it, and I was kinda right—it was funny, but clung so fervently to its goal of being a classic rom-com in every plot point (except gay) that I spent half the movie debating whether it was supposed to be a parody. I’m much more optimistic about Prime Video’s own stab at the formula, Red, White, & Royal Blue, which drops straight-to-streaming on Aug. 11, not only because I won’t have to leave the house to watch it, or because the premise is classic rom-com gold (the questioningly queer son of the president falls for the closeted queer son of the British royal family), but because I read the bestselling Casey McQuiston novel it’s based on, and I thought it was perfect fluff.Red, White, & Royal Blue - Official Trailer | Prime VideoMeanwhile, if you’re a masochist looking forward to the debut of Saw X in theaters on Sept. 29, you can prepare by bingeing the first six films in the exponentially unhinged horror franchise when they drop on Prime Video on Aug. 1. Other film highlights from this month’s surprisingly stacked schedule: recent theatrical releases Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves (Aug. 25), Women Talking (Aug. 29), and Cocaine Bear (Aug. 15).Here’s everything else coming to Prime Video and Amazon-owned, ad-supported Freevee in August, including Puppy Love (Aug. 18 on Freevee), which is somehow not the first film based on a viral BuzzFeed video.
