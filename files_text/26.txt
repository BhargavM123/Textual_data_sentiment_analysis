For anyone who still doubted, Netflix’s Castlevania anime put to bed the notion that all video games adaptations are bad. That series followed an unlikely trio of characters—Trevor Belmont, Sypha Belnades, and Alucard—who went to war against Dracula and his army of vampires. Following the series’ success, there’s new a spinoff called Castlevania: Nocturne that will follow a new character, Richter Belmont. Castlevania: Nocturne takes place during the French Revolution, as Vampire Queen Erzsebet Báthory colludes with the French Aristocracy. Richter’s adventure is to stop Erzsebet with help from a Caribbean sorceress Annette and magician Maria Renard. The trailer depicts Richter as a pretty different protagonist than Trevor Belmont.Castlevania: Nocturne | Official Teaser Trailer | NetflixWhat is Castlevania: Nocturne based on?Castlevania: Nocture is inspired by the Castlevania video game series developed by Konami in 1993—specifically Castlevania: Rondo of Blood and its follow up, Symphony of the Night.
